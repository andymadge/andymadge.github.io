> Regarding transferring songs out of iTunes, readers point out that you can select, drag and drop songs from iTunes to a Windows Explorer or Mac Finder window to copy them to a destination folder, a much easier method than Friday's [iTunes Export tack](http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/free-your-music-from-itunes-with-itunes-exporter-280279.php). However, the drag and drop method does NOT create an M3U playlist like iTunes Export does. Also, when I tested drag and drop on an extra large playlist (over a thousand songs), it refused to do a thing. For shorter lists it worked like a charm. _Thanks, 'hackers!_
