SysInternals tools are a fantastic set of free utilities written by [Mark Russinovich](http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/about.aspx) and Bryce Cogswell.  There are invaluable for system admins and Windows Power Users.  

There is now a website that allows you to run most of the SysInternals tools directly, so you don't have to find the right page, download it and unzip.  You just run it directly from:

`http://live.sysinternals.com/<tool>.exe`

e.g.
<http://live.sysinternals.com/procexp.exe>

This works better in Internet Explorer than Firefox, since you can run the tool without saving it first.

NOTE: Make sure there's no slash at the end.
