A pastebin is a website that allows you to paste text in order to share it with someone else on the web. They are useful for troubleshooting all sorts of programming and configuration issues.

[Pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/) appears to be the original, and it allows a wide variety of syntax highlighting and also the creation of private Pastebins (private in the sense that only your content should be on there, but still available to anyone who knows the URL)

[www.pastebin.ca](http://www.pastebin.ca/){.broken_link} doesn't appear to be working properly at the moment so I can't say much about it.
