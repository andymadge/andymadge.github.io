* Humans will always make mistakes, for a variety of reasons (for example lack of experience, skill, concentration, understanding etc.)
* Mistakes are the best way to learn
* We should not have a culture of blame
* Mistakes are not caused by people, they are caused by failure of process.
* When a mistake occurs, the most important thing to do is to analyse what happened, and then change the process to prevent it happening again
    * basically [keep asking 'why'](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/01/22/five-whys/) until you get to the root cause
    * the changes might mean having a checklist, or adding a review/signoff stage, or using software permissions to enforce something
