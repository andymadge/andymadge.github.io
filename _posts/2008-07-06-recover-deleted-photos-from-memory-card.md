This article is written from the point of view of recovering deleted photos from a digital camera memory card, but most of the software will work to recover any type of file from any disk drive.

The first thing you must do is stop using the memory card.Â  The more you use the card, the less likely that you will be able to recover the photos.

There are loads of free utilities that will recover photos, and I suggest trying them in the following order:

  1. **Zero Assumption Recovery** 
  * Full version is paid-for but the photo recovery option is free
  * Download [here](http://www.z-a-recovery.com/zar83setup.exe){.broken_link}
  * Follow [these instructions](http://www.z-a-recovery.com/demo-ir.htm){.broken_link}

  2. **Recuva**
  * Download [here](http://www.recuva.com/download)
  * Install it and follow the wizard which guides you through the recovery process

  3. **Undelete Plus**
  * Download [here](http://www.undelete-plus.com/download.html)
  * Follow [these instructions](http://www.undelete-plus.com/help/7_quickstart.html){.broken_link}

If you&#8217;ve tried all of those and been unsuccessful, then I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s not looking very promising, but if you want to continue trying here are a few more utils:
