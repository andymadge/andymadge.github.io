In OS X you can swap between applications in a similar way to Windows (Alt+Tab on Windows, &#8984;+Tab on OS X) however there's one important difference - Windows swaps between all open windows, but OS X only swaps between apps.Â  The problem is that in OS X you can switch to the right application but the window you want can be minimized.

To restore the window from the dock you need to:

  1. Hold &#8984; 
  2. Press Tab until the correct app is highlighted
  3. Hold &#8997;
  4. Release &#8984;
  5. Release &#8997;

It's a bit tricky but you soon get the hang of it and it's easier than picking up the mouse <img src="/assets/images/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
