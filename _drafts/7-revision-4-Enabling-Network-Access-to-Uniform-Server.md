<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uniformserver.com/">Uniform Server</a> is a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAMP">WAMP</a> package that I use in my web development setup. The default installation sets the web server to allow access only from the local machine.Â  This can be a problem if you want to show something to a colleague etc. because they will be denied access.

I found the following instructions [here](http://teachageek.com/2006/07/18/how-to-enable-the-uniform-server-for-public-access.aspx)
