Ubuntu is based on Debian, so I followed the instructions on the Slim Devices website [here](http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/Debian_Package) and it worked fine. It basically involves adding the Slim Devices repository to Synaptic Package Manager (Settings/Repository->Third Party) and then installing using apt-get.

The next thing to do is mount the network share so it can be accessed by SlimServer.
